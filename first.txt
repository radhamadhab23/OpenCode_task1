1. explain very briefly the difference between git and github.
Here's a list of differences between Git and GitHub:

Purpose: Git is a version control system, while GitHub is a web-based platform built on top of Git for version control and collaboration.

Local vs. cloud-based: Git is a local version control system that runs on the developer's computer, while GitHub is a cloud-based platform that stores code repositories on servers owned and managed by GitHub.

Features: Git focuses on version control functionality such as committing, branching, and merging, while GitHub provides features for collaboration, such as pull requests, issues, and project boards.

Usage: Git is used primarily for code version control and management, while GitHub is used for version control, collaboration, bug tracking, project management, and more.

Accessibility: Git requires command-line knowledge and setup, while GitHub has a graphical user interface and can be accessed through a web browser.

Community: GitHub has a large developer community that provides support and contributes to open-source projects, while Git is primarily used by smaller, decentralized development teams.

Cost: Git is free and open-source, while GitHub offers free plans with limited features and paid plans with more features and storage.

In conclusion, Git and GitHub both have their unique strengths and are used together by many developers to manage their code and collaborate on projects.


2.explain very briefly any 5 basic git commands
Ans-git init - Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

git clone - Clones an existing Git repository from a remote location to your local machine.

git add - Adds files to the staging area, ready to be committed to the repository.

git commit - Saves changes to the Git repository by creating a new commit with a message describing the changes.

git push - Publishes local commits to a remote repository, such as GitHub, to share code and collaborate with others.

3.How to make a pull request?
Ans-A pull request is a way to propose changes to a code repository that is hosted on a platform like GitHub. Here's a basic outline of how to make a pull request:

Fork the repository: Go to the repository you want to contribute to and click the "Fork" button to create a copy of the repository in your own account.

Clone the repository: Clone the repository you just forked to your local machine.

Create a new branch: Create a new branch for the changes you want to make. This allows you to keep your changes separate from the main code until they're approved.

Make changes: Make the desired changes to the code in your local repository.

Commit changes: Commit your changes to your local repository using the git commit command.

Push changes to your fork: Push your changes to your fork of the repository using the git push command.

Submit a pull request: Go to the repository you forked on the web and click the "Compare & pull request" button. Write a descriptive message explaining your changes, and then click the "Create pull request" button.

The repository maintainer will then review your changes and either merge them into the main repository or provide feedback on what needs to be changed.
